Sir Trevor JS Post Editor for Wordpress. A replacement content editor entirely re-imagined for the web - intuitive, simple and block based.

== Description ==

Sir Trevor JS Post Editor for Wordpress. A replacement content editor entirely re-imagined for the web - intuitive, simple, block based and very easy to learn. This editor keeps posts nice and uniform in style - even when many people of different skill levels are editing your site.

This plugin allows you to edit posts both in or outside of Sir Trevor. Posts you started in your old editor can still be edited in the old editor and posts started in Sir Trevor can be edited with Sir Trevor.

This plugin also completely streamlines the image upload process. Users no longer need to deal with the Wordpress media dialog which has been replaced with a simple drag and drop upload field.

Tweet block is not currently supported.

== Installation ==

1. Upload `sir-trevor-wp` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
